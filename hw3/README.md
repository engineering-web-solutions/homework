# Homework 3

Due: Thursday, February 15, 2018 by 3:30pm

Estimated Time: 1-1.5 hours

1. **CSSify some HTML.** For this homework, we're going to have you apply some CSS to your HTML. You can use the HTML file you did for homework for week 1, or you can just create a new HTML file.

   Work through [w3schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/). For your CSS, you will have to demonstrate each of the following:

   * *Colors.* Use at least 3 different color formats e.g. RGB, Hex, HSL, names.
   * *Background.* Have at least one element with a solid color background and at least one element with an image background.
   * *Border.* Give at least one element a (visible) border with a non-default `border-style`.
   * *Margin/Padding.* Apply both `margin` and `padding` to the same element. Explain to yourself the difference.
   * *Height/Width.* Define at least one element by pixels and at least one element by percentage. What happens when you apply `width` and `max-width` to the same element?
   * *Text.* Change the color of some text. Also, apply at least one additional text property of your choice.
   * *Font.* Implement all the font properties except for `font-variant`, unless you want to.
     * For `font-family`, we're going to import our own font instead of using the default fonts. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and find a font you like. Click the red + or "Select This Font" button to add the font to your selected fonts. Open the popup window in the bottom right and follow the instructions to use that font. You don't need to download the font on to your computer; you just need to link the font in a `<link>` tag in your HTML and apply it with the `font-family` tag in your CSS.

   Make sure your HTML and CSS work and demonstrate each of the following bullet points above. The specific content of your page is up to you.

   Upload both as attachments to a Collab assignment.
