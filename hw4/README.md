# Homework 4

Due: Thursday, February 22, 2018 by 3:30pm

Estimated Time: 30-45 minutes

**1. Continue with long-term project.** Meet with your team. Just like we did in class last week, come up with 5 potential solutions for your problem statement. Write up short 1 or 2 sentence descriptions for each of the 5 potential solutions. Put these in one document and have one person per group upload to Collab. If your group likes one particular idea and wants to paper prototype it like we did in class last week, your group can draw out a detailed paper prototype. If your group decides to do this, you can upload this for credit instead of the 5 potential solutions.
