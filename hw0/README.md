# Homework 0

Due: Thursday, January 25, 2018 by 3:30pm

Estimated Time: 30-45min

1. **Take Collab survey.** It's on Collab. Duh?
2. **Create a GitHub account** if you don't have one already. Pick the free plan, unless you don't want to?
3. **Take GitHub survey on Collab.** It's also on Collab. This is just to get your GitHub username.
4. **Download an editor.** We personally like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), but there are plenty of other editors e.g. [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Notepad++](), [Atom.io](https://atom.io/). It doesn't matter what you use as long as you like it. :)

If you run into any issues, email us Disha Jain (dj9am@virginia.edu) and/or David Zhao (dz6hu@virginia.edu), whomever you like better.
