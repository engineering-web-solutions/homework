Due: Thursday, February 29, 2018 by 3:30pm

Estimated Time: 90 minutes

**1. Pick your best idea and write out a detailed plan.** This plan should include details on the following topics:

* What's your problem statement?
* What's your product idea? How will it work? What platform will you develop it for (Mobile/Web/Native)? What languages will you use?
* Who will use your product? How are you going to get them to use it?

Include a sketch or rudimentary wireframe in your write-up. We're looking for some details, not just broad concepts. There's no limit or requirement to how long this write-up should be, but we should be able to tell your group has a fleshed out idea. Upload to Collab, one per group.
