Due: Thursday, February 8, 2018 by 3:30pm

Estimated Time: 30-45 minutes

**1. Find a source. [50%]** So, we're starting the final project to design something to change the college experience for the better. First, we need to understand our users and their problems. Your first task is to find a source. This can be a friend, an article, an interview, anything that provides firsthand knowledge about the issues with the college experience. *We suggest a friend because that's easy.* Write down problems your source has with the college experience and whatever insights you gained into their viewpoint like we did in class.

Submit this to Collab individually.

**2. Make a problem statement with your group [50%].** Assemble your mastermind team! Everyone should have a source already so have everyone share their problems and what they learned. Then, as a group, make a problem statement that tackles at least one of the problems shared. It does not have to solve all the problems shared, but it must tackle at least one.

Write this problem statement in a document with all group member's names. Have one person submit to Collab.
