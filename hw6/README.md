# Homework 6

Due: Thursday, April 5, 2018 by 3:30pm

Estimated Time: 90 minutes

**1. Begin story-boarding your final project.** In your last homework, you and your team chose and detailed your idea. Now it is time to create a detailed wire-frame.:

* We only need you to turn in a wire-frame of your main screen
* This should be a more detailed version of the wire-frame you turned in last time

You WILL be coding this for homework next week!
